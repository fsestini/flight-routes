Big Data tool that analyzes raw ADS-B data to determine standard flight routes
between pairs of airports. Written in Apache Spark, runs on Hadoop clusters.

This work was carried out by Filippo Sestini and Davide Dal Bianco as a project
for the Large-Scale Data Engineering course at Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.

A paper documenting the work can be found here:

A visualization frontend using data produced by the tool can be found here:

# PROJECT

To compile the project run the following command from the `project' folder:

$ sbt package

The resulting jar can be submitted to spark using the following command:

$ spark-submit --class [classname] --packages com.databricks:spark-avro_2.10:2.0.1,com.databricks:spark-csv_2.10:1.5.0 --jars lib/libadsb-2.0.jar,lib/ssj-3.2.0.jar --master yarn --deploy-mode cluster target/scala-2.10/adsbtools_2.10-1.0.jar [arguments]

Where [classname] must be replaced with one of the following:
- nl.vu.adsbtools.Positions
- nl.vu.adsbtools.FlightDetection
- nl.vu.adsbtools.RouteClustering
- nl.vu.adsbtools.Identification

Both `airlines.dat' and `airports.csv' must be present in the home of the hdfs
file system. The location of `airports.csv' must also be submitted explicitly as
command line argument to spark-submit when running the class FlightDetection.

# VISUALIZATION

You can run the web based visualization typing the following commands from the `visualization' folder:

$ npm install
$ npm start

The webserver is then listening on the port 3000. A different port can be set using the PORT environment variable

You can also browse the application at the address https://flight-routes.herokuapp.com/
